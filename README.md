I'm an academic researcher transitioning into machine learning. My academic training is in probability
theory. To develop my computer vision skillset, I trained the Faster R-CNN architecture on a custom dataset built from pdf documents. My github username is from [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounds_of_Love) I like. :)

## machine learning projects

> [ [papers object detection](https://the-ninth-wave.github.io/vision-projects/jupyter/2021/10/21/math-papers-v17.html) ] ... This notebook contains a machine learning pipeline built for a custom dataset. I assembled the dataset from a collection of pdfs, a corpus of scientific documents. Feeding the data into a PyTorch implementation of the [Faster R-CNN](https://towardsdatascience.com/faster-rcnn-object-detection-f865e5ed7fc4) architecture, I trained the network to draw bounding boxes around labeled equations, those which are referenced throughout the paper. I see this as a small first step towards a more intricate object detection tool for extracting the logical structure of a math paper (to begin with) given its input as a pdf.

## notes

[geometric deep learning](https://the-ninth-wave.github.io/geometric-deep-learning)

> [ [notebook one](https://the-ninth-wave.github.io/geometric-deep-learning/jupyter/2021/10/21/GDL1.html) ] ... This first notebook lays out a theoretical foundations for using the geometric deep learning (GDL) toolkit, following the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478) of Bronstein, Bruna, Cohen and Veličković. GDL is a relatively new perspective on neural network design. This perspective unifies recent successful architectures, and provides recipes for efficient architecture design leveraging symmetries of the input data. 

> [ [notebook two](https://the-ninth-wave.github.io/geometric-deep-learning/jupyter/2021/10/24/GDL2.html) ] ... The goal of this second notebook is to implement the geometric deep learning paradigm in the simplest possible setting, using PyTorch. I am playing around with how to visualize tensors, in order to observe the effects of a simple convolutional network on various input signals. I'm particularly interested in seeing what changes post-training, with a longer-term goal of running experiments with the MNIST dataset from a recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06442) to better understand possible connections to spin glass theory. In the shorter term, I plan to practice with the GDL framework by implementing it, via [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), when the data has specific symmetries beyond those leading to the traditional convolutional architecture. For example, biological data with [reverse complement](http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.html) symmetry.
