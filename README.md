I'm an academic researcher transitioning into a machine learning research scientist or research engineer. My academic training is in probability theory. My github username is from [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hounds_of_Love) I like. :)

### notes

[geometric deep learning](https://the-ninth-wave.github.io/geometric-deep-learning)

> __[__ [notebook one](https://the-ninth-wave.github.io/geometric-deep-learning/jupyter/2021/10/21/GDL1.html) __]__ ... This first notebook lays theoretical foundations for using the geometric deep learning (GDL) toolkit, following the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478) of Bronstein, Bruna, Cohen and Veličković. GDL is a relatively new perspective on neural network design. This perspective unifies recent successful architectures, and provides recipes for efficient architecture design leveraging symmetries of the input data. 

> __[__ [notebook two](https://the-ninth-wave.github.io/geometric-deep-learning/jupyter/2021/10/24/GDL2.html) __]__ ... The goal of this notebook is to implement the GDL paradigm in a simple setting, with PyTorch. I am playing around with how to visualize tensors, in order to observe the effects of a simple convolutional network on various input signals. I'm particularly interested in seeing what changes post-training, with a longer-term goal of running experiments with the MNIST dataset from a recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06442) to better understand possible connections to spin glass theory. In the shorter term, I plan to practice with the GDL framework by implementing it, via [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), when the data has specific symmetries beyond those leading to the traditional convolutional architecture. For example, biological data with [reverse complement](http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/rev_comp.html) symmetry.
